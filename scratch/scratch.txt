Questing app notes

brainstorming..
-You gain experience by turning in quests
-'clear completed' is 5xp
-each completed individual quest is 5xp
-each quest abandoned removes 5xp
-levels- 1 at 100xp, 2 at 200xp, 3 at 300xp..
you gain levels by gaining experience
each level gained, you earn coins
coins can buy either a dragon egg, or a couple items that help increase dragon stregnth, speed, or stamina
dragon eggs will hatch after 200xp, or at level 2, if you are level 1
once a user has purchase an egg, a ticker for random enounters starrts?
random encounters are all with differnt level enemies that should scale with user level
user loses exp for losing enounters and abandoning quests
user potentially lose coin for losing encounters?

You can control multiple dragons and decide which dragon to battle with for each encounter
each egg you buy will hatch a dragon with random starting stats


functions to add:
-add object param for exp- completed daily + one time daily completed
-
-if a one time quest has been entered once, it cannot be entered again?
